Doc-Searcher is a simple and flexible document search application, leveraging the capabilities of Rust and Elasticsearch (by default) to provide efficient and effective full-text search in documents. This project aims to offer a straightforward solution for indexing and searching through a large corpus of documents with the speed and accuracy provided by Elasticsearch.

The maing goal - implement simple but powerful system of storing and indexing documents with searhing functionality (full-text, semantic). I decided to use elasticsearch as default searching engine but you may using own solutions by implementing SearcherService async trait for Tantiby, QDrant or own solution...
